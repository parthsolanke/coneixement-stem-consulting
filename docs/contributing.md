   git checkout dev
   ```
2. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin dev
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

### 3. Making Changes

- Follow the existing code style and conventions.
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Update or add documentation as needed.
- Add tests for any new functionality or changes.

### 4. Pushing Changes

Push your changes to your branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push origin feature-name
```

### 5. Creating a Pull Request

Once your changes are ready, create a pull request to merge into the `dev` branch:

1. Go to the original repository.
2. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
3. Click "New Pull Request."
4. Select your feature branch as the source and `dev` as the target branch.
